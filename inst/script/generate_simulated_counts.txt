The data in "simulated_counts.txt" was generated by running the following command:

./simulate_growth_competition.py

using the script located at https://github.com/imkeller/simulate_pooled_screen. This script performs a computational simulation of a typical CRISPR dropout screen. The default parameters where used to generate the here provided simulated counts.
